The Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) has expressed condolences to the family, friends and media colleagues following the passing of Libby Lloyd. “Ms Lloyd’s contribution to the MDDA and to the community media sector will always be remembered for the firm foundations she laid for the agency to continue its invaluable role of providing access to the media for all – particularly our historically disadvantaged communities who have been side-lined by the traditional media,” MDDA Acting Chairperson Musa Sishange said. Lloyd passed away on 19 January 2018 after battling an illness since last year. At the time of her passing, Lloyd served on a panel of experts that assisted the Telecommunications and Postal Services Ministry in the development of the Integrated White Paper on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Policy In addition to her many achievements in the media sector, she was the founding Chief Executive Officer of the MDDA following its establishment by an Act of Parliament in 2002. “Appointed in August 2003, Lloyd played a defining role in setting up the agency, not only establishing the operating systems but also forming long lasting strategic partnerships to harness the resources across the sector to the benefit of community media. “Under her leadership, which ran until 2006, the MDDA allocated financial support to just under 100 different media projects across all provinces of South Africa, with the MDDA board approving over R20 million in grants to these projects,” said the MDDA. Under Lloyd’s leadership the MDDA maintained an unbroken record of clean audits, testimony to the robust governance structures she and her management team had set up. “Through her work with the MDDA in creating an enabling environment for the community media sector, Lloyd’s legacy will include giving a concrete platform to the often-marginalized voices across all our communities, regardless of race, gender, disability and economic class,” said the MDDA. – SAnews.gov.za

Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Monday reshuffled station commanders at Krugersdorp and Kagiso police stations. The Minister believes that police management should be rotated to avoid them working in the same station for too long, which he says makes them prone to taking bribes. "The instructions are clear: protect our people, their property and exert the authority of the State," Minister Mbalula said. The Minister was in Krugersdorp, Mogale City, in Gauteng’s West Rand to report back to the community of Munsieville and Kagiso on what has been done since their violent protest a week ago. The community in the drug and prostitution ridden area went on the rampage last week, torching houses believed to belong to drug lords. The protest also saw the community vandalising State property and looting shops. This was after a young girl went missing in Kagiso and was later found at a drug den in Krugersdorp. As an intervention and response to these concerns, police, working closely with the municipality officials of Mogale City, identified and demolished old buildings that were identified as drug dens. "It must be clear to all drug lords, we will identify and destroy drug dens. We can't live side by side with criminals. The police must exact the authority of the State," Minister Mbalula said. Police also arrested drug dealers, closed illegal shebeens and confiscated drugs. "As citizens of Mogale City, you spoke to your government last week. We came, we listened and we acted. We urge our people to continue voicing their dissatisfaction in a peaceful manner.” The Minister warned residents against burning State property, urging the community to take ownership of government services and lead efforts to protect them. He also emphasized the need for viable and vigilant policing to increase public trust for SAPS amongst the residents so they never get tempted to take law into their own hands. - SAnews.gov.za

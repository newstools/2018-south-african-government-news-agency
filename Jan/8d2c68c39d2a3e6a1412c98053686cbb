Steve Biko Academic Hospital management has appealed to the public using the hospital to cooperate with staff members, who are fixing faulty lifts. “The hospital would also like to assure facility users that the matter is receiving attention from the provincial health’s head office. The technicians are hard at work and it is expected that the lifts will be working again as soon as possible. “We will continue to monitor the progress and ensure that all our lifts are fully operational. The hospital is committed to offering quality health care services and guarding against anything that can possibly cause discomfort to the patients we serve,” said hospital CEO, Dr Mathabo Mathebula. – SAnews.gov.za

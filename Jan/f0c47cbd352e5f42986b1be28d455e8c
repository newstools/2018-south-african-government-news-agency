The Department of Higher Education and Training has given students another chance to apply at the Capricorn Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) College in Polokwane. “I am aware of the long queues at Peter Mokaba Stadium and have asked the principal to go and speak to them and allay their fears. There is no need to be in queues overnight, as all students will be allowed to apply for available spaces on Monday from 6am,” said Deputy Minister Buti Manamela. The Deputy Minister will visit the registration centre set up by Capricorn TVET College at the Peter Mokaba Stadium, Polokwane, on Monday. The Deputy Minister advised that those who can should consider approaching Waterberg and Lephalale TVET colleges that still have spaces available. “I am pleased at the demand for education by our youth and excited that we are indeed making education fashionable. This also shows that TVET colleges should invest in better IT systems to ensure smooth and hassle free registration process,” said the Deputy Minister. “I will be visiting the pop-up registration centre at Peter Mokaba Stadium this morning to monitor the registration process. I urge students to cooperate with staff and management of the institution so that we conclude the registration process quickly,” said Deputy Minister Manamela. The Deputy Minister will also visit the University of Limpopo and Tshwane University of Technology. He urged political parties to refrain from heightening tensions around access to free higher education. “I also urge political parties to exercise restraint in their communications and not heighten tensions in an already volatile and emotional situation. At the end of the day, the education of the African child remains our priority. “We should not prey on the anxiety of poor and working class young people, whose only interest is to access free education. Let’s all work together to achieve this and build a better South Africa,” said the Deputy Minister. – SAnews.gov.za

The 11 traffic officers arrested in Mokopane, Limpopo, for bribery and corruption are due to appear in the court this morning. The officers, aged between 32 and 54, were arrested by the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and the Hawks this week. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said their arrests follow intensive investigations into the allegation of bribery and unethical conduct among traffic officers in the province. Zwane said investigations are continuing and more arrests can be expected. “The success of this operation should send a clear message to traffic officers that crime does not pay and they must strictly adhere to the terms and conditions of their employment.” The latest arrests bring the total number of traffic officers arrested in this province to 33 since December 2017. Meanwhile, RTMC has also sent its heartfelt condolences to the families of two Johannesburg Metro Police officers killed on Monday night in Johannesburg. A motorist is alleged to have ploughed through the blockage, slamming into three cars and killing the two officers. “The incident provides further evidence of why human factors rank so high as the main contributors to high road traffic fatalities in South Africa.  We further urge all road users to obey traffic rules and cooperate with law enforcement officers,” said the CEO of the RTMC, Makhosini Msibi. - SAnews.gov.za

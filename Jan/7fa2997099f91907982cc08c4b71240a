South Africa has welcomed the first high-level bilateral meeting between neighbours Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea. The meeting, which took place on Tuesday at the truce village of Panmunjeom near the inter-Korean border was the first in almost two years between the two countries. “South Africa is encouraged by the resumption of direct, inter-Korean dialogue as the best way forward to ensure lasting peace and prosperity to all on the Korean Peninsula, for the entire world’s benefit. “We wish to pledge our full support for this joint initiative as it unfolds and progresses,” the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) said on Thursday. A joint press release issued after the dialogue said the DPRK had agreed to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics to kick off in February in South Korea's eastern county of Pyeongchang, and the 2018 Paralympics in March. The two Koreas indicated that they will soon hold follow-up talks to deal with the logistics concerning participation in the Games. Seoul and Pyongyang also agreed to hold a separate dialogue between their military authorities after agreeing that they should make joint efforts to ease military tensions and create a peaceful environment on the Korean Peninsula, among others. The DPRK also reopened a military hotline with South Korea across the western border Tuesday during the inter-Korean high-level talks. - SAnews.gov.za-Xinhua

The Ministry of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) on Thursday confirmed the transfer of the Director General of Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), Mashwahle Diphofa, to the Department of Traditional Affairs (DTA). Having led the DPSA for a number of years and being knowledgeable about how government works, Diphofa will bring a wealth of experience and thus ensuring that there is no gap when the current Director General of DTA departs. “We believe that as a seasoned administrator, he will continue the work we have started of building a strong and sustainable institution of traditional leadership in South Africa as envisaged in our constitution,” said Minister van Rooyen. Diphofa will fill the position of Director General of the DTA, which is currently held by Dr Charles Nwaila. Dr Nwaila is retiring on 31 January 2018 after 40 years of dedicated service to the people of South Africa. Since his appointment at the DTA in 2010, Dr Nwaila has been a catalyst and led the transformation of the institution of traditional leadership. Minister van Rooyen, who will release a comprehensive media statement on the role played by Dr Nwaila in the public service, has wished him well in all his future endeavours. – SAnews.gov.za

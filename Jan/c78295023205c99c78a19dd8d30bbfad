Provisional taxpayers have until 31 January to file their income tax returns, their IRP6 documents, to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) through eFiling. A provisional taxpayer is any person who receives income, or to whom income accrues, other than a salary. This includes persons who receive rental income from a property, taxable interest income from investments or other income from a trade. SARS reminded taxpayers that channels such as the SARS mobisite, available at www.sarsefiling.mobi, are available for easy filing via one’s mobile device. It said late submission will result in penalties. “As a separate matter, the deadline of 31 January also applies to payments from individual taxpayers who filed personal income tax returns last year and were assessed to owe SARS money. “While harsh penalties and interest apply to late payments on the other hand, taxpayers in financial difficulty can approach SARS to defer payment or pay in instalments within qualifying criteria,” SARS said in a statement. Taxpayers who wish to make payment arrangements are advised to go to their nearest SARS branch or call the SARS Contact Centre on 0800 00 7277. Three main payment channels are available, including eFiling, via a bank or EFT. SARS branches do not accept payments, whether cash or cheque. – SAnews.gov.za

Eskom on Wednesday announced the permanent suspension of former acting Group Chief Executive and Chief Information Officer Sean Maritz. “The temporary suspension of Eskom’s Chief Information Officer, Mr. Sean Maritz, has now been converted to a permanent suspension pending an investigation into allegations of impropriety,” said the power utility in a brief media statement. In a tweet on Wednesday, Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said Maritz -- who was appointed in an acting capacity as group Chief Executive in October 2017 -- has been suspended pending an investigation into allegations of impropriety. “He was placed on temporary suspension last Friday, which has now been converted into a permanent suspension,” said Phasiwe. Earlier this month, the Presidency announced the appointment of a new board for the utility as an immediate measure to strengthen governance and management at the parastatal. “The company has been facing several challenges, including a weak financial position, declining revenues and governance failures, which are threatening the sustainability of the company going forward,” said the Presidency at the time. The appointment of the 13-member board, headed by seasoned businessman Jabu Mabuza, forms part of the measures to strengthen governance and management. At a media briefing on the utility’s interim results at its offices in Johannesburg, interim Group Chief Executive Phakamani Hadebe said despite challenges, he is confident that the power utility can turn the corner. “I am confident that Eskom can turn the corner. The challenges at Eskom are less about core operational issues,” said Hadebe. - SAnews.gov.za

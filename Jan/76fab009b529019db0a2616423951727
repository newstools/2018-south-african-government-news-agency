President Jacob Zuma will on Saturday receive a courtesy call from South Sudan President Salva Kiir at his official residence Mahlamba Ndlofu, in Pretoria. The Presidency said during the courtesy call it is expected that President Kiir will brief President Zuma on the political and security situation in South Sudan. In 2014 President Zuma appointed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as the Special Envoy to South Sudan to assist with the resolution of the political impasse in that country. South Africa and South Sudan enjoy good political relations. â€“ SAnews.gov.za

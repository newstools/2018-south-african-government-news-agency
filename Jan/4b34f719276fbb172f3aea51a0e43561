The Hawks have urged members of the public to report any illegal firearm dealings in communities. The specialist crime fighting unit has intensified operations to seize firearms from people involved in firearm trafficking, the illegal distribution thereof and legal entities involved in corruption and other illegal practices relating to firearms. “The general public is urged to report illegal firearms to Crime Stop or the provincial offices of the National Bureau for Illegal Firearm Control and Priority Violent Crime (NBIFCPVC), which are established countrywide within the Hawks,” the Hawks said on Wednesday. This call follows the seizure of 323 firearms from a firearm dealer in Pretoria last week on allegations of contravening the Firearms Control Act. According to Hawks spokesperson, Captain Lloyd Ramovha, the team placed the firearms dealership under scrutiny during December, following reports that the said establishment was in possession of firearms illegally. Ramovha said the ongoing probe has so far revealed that the dealership has an assortment of firearms registered in its name on the Enhanced Firearms Registration System (EFRS), which it could not account for. “The prescriptions of the Firearms Control Act are being followed in this regard and pending the outcome thereof, charges of negligent loss of firearms or failure to report the loss of firearms will be added for investigation.” The seized firearms will be subjected to further forensic analysis in order to establish their origins and whether they were used in the commission of any criminal offences. No arrests have been made as yet, as investigations continue. – SAnews.gov.za

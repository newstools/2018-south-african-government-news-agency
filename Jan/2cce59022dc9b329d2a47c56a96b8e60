A man, who took money from people under the pretext that he was doing so under the instruction of North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, was found guilty of fraud in the Mahikeng Regional Court. The court on Wednesday handed Thato Frederick Hengary a five-year imprisonment sentence, wholly suspended for a period of three years, on condition that the accused is not convicted of an offence involving dishonesty committed during the period of suspension. “He pleaded guilty to the charge of fraud and admitted to receiving money he was not entitled to. He also admitted that he knew he was not acting on the instructions of Premier Mahumapelo and that his actions were unlawful,” said the Office of the Premier. Meanwhile, the Premier Mahumapelo welcomed the sentence. “This must be a lesson to the accused that crime does not pay. I am happy that the law has taken its course,” said Premier Mahumapelo. Hengary was arrested by the Hawks in December 2016 near Kuruman after he had impersonated Mahumapelo while committing fraud. In some instances, he concocted stories to extract money from people pretending to be acting under the instruction of the Premier. - SAnews.gov.za

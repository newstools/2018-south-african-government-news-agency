Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has condemned the stabbing of a teacher at Bosele Middle School in Manyeding Village near Kuruman in the Northern Cape, allegedly at the hands of a pupil. She described the incident as horrific. According to reports, a 15-year-old Grade 8 pupil from the Northern Cape allegedly stabbed a teacher to death at his home. “The holistic education of our learners is a societal matter, and we all as communities, parents and guardians need to instil in our children the notion that violence is not the answer. Problems will not be solved through violence.” Minister Motshekga said. The matter is still under police investigation and some details are yet to emerge, “but this form of violence needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms,” the Minister said. On Thursday, Provincial MEC for Education Martha Bartlett visited the family of the slain teacher and the school to establish if there are any particular challenges that need to be addressed, and to provide psycho-social services to the learners. Minister Motshekga said they are aware that the area in Kuruman, where the learner is from, faces a number of social challenges, such as a high number child-headed households, the break-down of the family structure, poverty and substance abuse, among others. “This therefore makes the role of the community and relevant government entities, in supporting our young people to mitigate these challenges ever more important,” the Minister said. – SAnews.gov.za

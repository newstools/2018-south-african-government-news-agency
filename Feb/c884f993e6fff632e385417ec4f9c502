A policewoman, stationed at Protea Glen, and an examiner from the Aganang Local Municipality in Polokwane have been arrested for allegedly scamming 23 job seekers out of about R230 000. “It is alleged that the two suspects took advantage of the 1 500 Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officers’ recruitment process and recruited an additional 23 bogus recruits,” City of Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said in a statement on Monday. The recruits paid R10 200 each, R200 was for fake medical certificate which was issued by the suspect. The city said new recruits undergo training for 18 months. The official training started in October. “I am informed that last week when the existing recruits reported for duty, they were joined by 23 youths who fell victim to the scam and arrived an hour late. Upon their arrival they produced fake appointment certificates which stated their salaries and which team they will be working with,” Mayor Mashaba said. He said the city’s Group Forensic Investigation Services Department and a team from the South African Police Service was called in to assist in questioning and taking down statements from 23 scam victims. “They all confirmed that they never received any form of training and paid R10 200 to the suspects. Most of them come from Limpopo and slept at one of the suspect’s home in Protea Glen,” Mayor Mashaba said. The victims of the scam pointed out the suspects, who were arrested at the weekend. “I am disappointed that a JMPD marked vehicle was used to transport the bogus recruits to the academy. This is a clear indication that someone from JMPD is involved in this scam,” he said. Mayor Mashaba said the city will work tirelessly and in collaboration with law enforcement institutions to fight against corruption. – SAnews.gov.za

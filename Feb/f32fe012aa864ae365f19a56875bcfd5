SA Rugby and Springbok coach Allister Coetzee have agreed to part ways with immediate effect. “SA Rugby announced on Friday that it had reached an agreement with Allister Coetzee to part ways with immediate effect,” it said. The Rugby Department of SA Rugby will manage the responsibilities of the Springbok coach until the national team’s coaching and management group for 2018 is confirmed later this month. Coetzee and SA Rugby agreed to terminate the relationship after a two-year association. Coetzee was appointed to the top post in April 2016 for a period of four years. “First and foremost, we had to assess what is in the best interests of the Springboks. We’d like to thank Allister for his passion and dedication to the Springbok cause and wish him every success in his next role,” said Chief Executive Officer of SA Rugby Jurie Roux. The former coach, who succeeded Heyneke Meyer, on Friday wished the team well going forward. “I have always held Springbok rugby dear to my heart and will continue to do so and for that reason, I think now is the time the team and me strike out in new directions. I wish Springbok rugby every success in the future – as I have always done,” said Coetzee. The confirmation of the Springbok management set-up is due to be completed before the end of February. - SAnews.gov.za

The Department of Military Veterans says it is seriously concerned over news that there are some military veterans who plan to undertake an illegal march to the Department of Military Veterans in Pretoria on Monday. “The department acknowledges and respects the Constitutional rights of the military veterans to raise their issues with the department regarding the benefits the department provides as well as related services. “However, the department urges the military veterans to do so in line with the laws of the country and to use the channels which have been established for this purpose. “The department is in constant engagement with South African National Military Veterans Association (SANMVA) and its affiliates to find seamless mechanism to provide the 11 benefits outlined in the Military Veterans Act 18 of 2011,” the department said in a statement on Friday. Currently, the department is working hard to process more than 11 000 applications for both basic and higher education support benefit for the academic year 2018, working with SANMVA and its affiliates. The department urged the military veterans and their dependents to desist from engaging in illegal protests and to work with the Department and their associations in finding lasting solutions to resolve the matters at hand. The department is currently working with law enforcement agencies to ensure that the safety of staff as well as property is not endangered. – SAnews.gov.za

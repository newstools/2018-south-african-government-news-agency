The Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) will be hosting a number of live broadcasts of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) to ensure the President’s message is spread far and wide. The live broadcasts, which take place at a venue within a community, aim to mobilise South Africans to watch the address, as well as give citizens an opportunity to actively engage in their own development. At some of the viewing sites, there will be community dialogues as well as participation from local leadership as part of the build-up to the delivery of the President’s address. The President will deliver the SONA to a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament, the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, at 7pm, on Thursday. The live viewing events will take place in the following municipalities: District municipality Local municipality Venue Joe Gqabi Municipality Walter Sisulu Municipality Takalani FM in Aliwal North Antos Boarding School Aliwal North Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Bay FM in Port Elizabeth Collegiate Girls’ High School, Port Elizabeth Alfred Nzo Municipality Mbizana Municipality Alfred Nzo Radio and Inkonjane FM Vukuzenzele Special School, Mbizana Buffalo City Metro Buffalo City Metro Mdantsane FM in Mdantsane, East London.

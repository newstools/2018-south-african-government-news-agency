African Union Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat says he is closely following the evolution of the political situation in Kenya. In a recently released statement, Mahamat said he notes with concern the organisation by the National Super Alliance (NASA) of a ceremony during which Raila Odinga was “sworn-in” as the “people’s President of Kenya”. Mahamat said an African Union Election Observer Mission, led by former President Thabo Mbeki, observed the elections, whose results were validated by the Kenyan Constitutional Court. “Against this backdrop and in line with its relevant instruments, notably the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, the African Union rejects all actions that undermine constitutional order and the rule of law. The chairperson urges all concerned to desist from any such actions, which also put the political stability of Kenya at risk. “He urges all stakeholders to act in strict compliance with the Constitution of Kenya and other relevant texts. The chairperson of the commission urges the people of Kenya to earnestly continue on the path of the rule of law and consolidation of their democratic institutions, and to eschew any acts that could undermine the stability of their country and its socio-economic development,” the AU said in a statement. Mahamat said the African Union stands ready to assist in any way deemed appropriate to defuse the current tension on the basis of the fundamental principle of the respect of constitutional order and the rule of law. – SAnews.gov.za
